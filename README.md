## Getting Started

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building the app

To build the app, run:

yarn build
```

## Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to Vercel on any merge to the `main` branch.

The production URL is https://www.chrishutchinson.me.

### PR deployments

Vercel handily sets up PR environments automatically, with a temporary domain for previewing, which can be used for testing before merging.
